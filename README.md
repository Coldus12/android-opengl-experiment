# Exterminator

An android game where the roaches kill you. Or do they?
Your objective is to kill all the roaches on a given level in a burning post-apocalyptic world. If you succeed you progress automatically to the next level.
There are infinite procedurally generated levels, with an increasing amount of roaches keen on eating you alive.

Playable characters:
- Denzel - Uses 2 pistols which seem to have an infinite ammo
- Justing - Cowboy with a shotgun (which also has infinite ammo)

# About the project
This was my homework for the [Mobile- and Web-based Software](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIAUAC00/en/ "Mobile- and Web-based Software") course.

Last semester we had a computer graphics course and I wanted to make an Android game with the use of OpenGL.
